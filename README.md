# Hosting a Website with Docker

This project demonstrates how to **containerize and host a simple website** using **Docker**. We will create a Docker image that runs a web server (such as Nginx or Apache) and serves a static website, which can be easily deployed on any machine with Docker installed.

## Features
- **Dockerized**: The website is packaged and deployed within a Docker container.
- **Web Server**: We use **Nginx** as the web server to serve the website's static files.
- **Portability**: The website can be easily deployed to any platform that supports Docker, including **AWS EC2**, **Azure**, or **local machines**.
